This is a personal project of mine

It is supposed to be a marketplace for my practice in react and laravel

## Backend

## FrontEnd
React JS (Create React App)

## Setup environment

Git clone my repo

Locate lareactzada_frontend and composer update

run php artisan key:generate

PHP artisan serve

After that locate lareactzada_backend
npm install
npm start

ENV Variable can be found at .env at root
